WARNING:Pack:2574 - The F7 multiplexer symbol
   "HMM_viterbi/silHMM/Mmux__n2468_2_f7_2" and its I1 input driver
   "HMM_viterbi/silHMM/Mmux_feature_index[4]_PWR_33_o_select_408_OUT41" were
   implemented suboptimally in the same slice component. The function generator
   could not be placed directly driving the F7 multiplexer. The design will
   exhibit suboptimal timing.
