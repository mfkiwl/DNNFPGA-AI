*     The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a computationally efficient          *
*     algorithm for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The FFT    *
*     Core can compute 8 to 65536-point forward or inverse complex             *
*     transforms on up to 12 parallel channels. The input data is a vector     *
*     of complex values represented as two's-complement numbers 8 to 34        *
*     bits wide or single precision floating point numbers 32 bits wide.       *
*     The phase factors can be 8 to 34 bits wide. All memory is on-chip        *
*     using either Block RAM or Distributed RAM. Three arithmetic types are    *
*     available: full-precision unscaled, scaled fixed-point, and              *
*     block-floating point. Several parameters are run-time configurable:      *
*     the point size, the choice of forward or inverse transform, and the      *
*     scaling schedule. Four architectures are available to provide a          *
*     tradeoff between size and transform time.                                *
